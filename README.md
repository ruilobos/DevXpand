# DevXpand

## Objective

DevXpand is an educational web application for developers. The application allows users to publish their courses and also enrol in other available courses. One of the main goals during development was to gain experience in developing web applications that can be used by multiple users in different sections.

It is possible to divide the course into different lessons and for each lesson define the material to be used (videos, PDFs, external references) DevXpand also has a forum system for students' questions.

## Description

As a student, when you register with DevXpand, you will have access to all available courses. By enrolling in a course you will see all existing classes as well as videos and support materials. For each course, there is a Q&A Forum so that you can ask questions with the instructor or other students on the course.

As an instructor, DevXpand allows you to create the course your way. It is possible to divide the course into as many classes as you wish, and for each class, you can list the videos you choose as well as all the support material you need.
